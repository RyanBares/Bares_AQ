The purpose of this file is to overview how to navigate the EPA's data API known as the Air Quality System (AQS).  This overview is specifically for downloading data from a single site (i.e. DAQ Hawthorne, or Rosepark).   

The homepage for the AQS can be found here: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html

The AQS API works by sending requests via any web browser (i.e. chrome, firefox).  Once the request is received the API will send a response or data to the html page from which the request was issues. So all you need to do is enter a line of code with the appropriately structured request into the address bar of a web browser and wait for the data.


# STEP 1: Set Up a User Name and Get a Key
Open a web browser and enter the following command into the address bar:
https://aqs.epa.gov/data/api/signup?email=myemail@example.com

Replace "myemail@example.com" with the email address you want associated with your key.  The API will return a message informing you that the request was received and a key will be sent to the email you entered.  

The key they send you will be used in all subsequent data requests.  If you lose it you can always request a new one.


# STEP 2: Formatting a Request
The request commands are structured as a series of user selected variables.

Variable     | Description
-------------|------------
email        | The email you registered in Step 1 
key          | The key sent to that email
para         | The measurement (parameter) you want to download
bdate        | The start date you want to download* 
edate        | The end data you want to download*    
state        | The state the measurement site you want to download from resides in
county       | The county the measurement site you want to download from resides in
site         | The site ID you want to download data from

*Note: you can only download one year of data at a time

In the address bar of a web browser, enter the desired variables into the appropriate spots of the request command. An example of a fully executable request is below: 

**Example:**
https://aqs.epa.gov/data/api/sampleData/bySite?email=ryan.bares@utah.edu&key=tauperam28&param=42101&bdate=20180101&edate=20181231&state=49&county=035&site=3006

If you were to use the above request you would get CO data (param=42101) for the enitre year of 2018 (bdate=20180101, edate=20181231) from DAQ Hawthorne (site=3006) located in Salt Lake County (county=035), Utah (state=49).  Note that the email is registered to my utah.edu account, which was issued the key tauperam28 as described in **STEP 1**.  


# Common Parameters for Air Quality Data

Species                      | Parameter Code
-----------------------------|----------------------------------
Carbon Monoxide (CO)         | 42101
Nitrogen Oxide (NO)          | 42601
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)       | 42602
Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)     | 42603
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)         | 42401
Particulate Matter (PM2.5)   | 88101

A list of all available parameters can be found by requesting the API to return a list using the following request:

Don't forget to update the email and key! 

# Common Sites Codes for SLV
Site                         | Site Code
-----------------------------|----------------------------------
Hawthorne                    | 3006
Rose Park                    | 3010
Inland Port                  | 3017
Magna                        | 1001
Lake Park                    | 3014

# STEP 3: Saving Files From Web Browser
Once you have executed the command the API will return data to the HTML browser formatted for a .json file.  Note that it can take a while to receive all the data so be patient with it. 

To save the data from the html page to your local drive go to: 
**File -> Save Page As...** 

Name the file and select .json as the format. 

Boom!  You have successfully formatted a request for data from the EPA's AQS API, received that data and saved it!
